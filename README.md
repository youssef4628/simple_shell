<p align="center">
This endeavor represents the realization of a shell developed as a significant achievement within the context of the C programming course at ALX Africa Software Engineering. </br>
The gates of shell represent a first trimester project, aiming to aid students in comprehending the intricate principles underlying the shell program. These encompass processes, system calls, bit manipulation, file management, error handling, and more. </br>
The shell is a straightforward UNIX command interpreter designed to emulate the features of the basic shell (sh).. </br>
This program was coded entirely in C Language.
